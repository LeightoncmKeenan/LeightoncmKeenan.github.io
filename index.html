            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I strive to be a determined and hard-working mother, wife and worker- keeping my faith and
            loyalty to Christ as my top priority. I will dedicate my time into building a stable future for
            myself, focusing on my education now and later down the road, focusing on giving my children
            and family opportunities to thrive.</p>
